## Probability Analysis of a Dice Roll
Just wanted to test the cumulative proportions idea of dices and generalize a bit. The goal is to have variable trials, number of sides of the dice, picking one side to be biased, and how much it is biased. Then visually inspecting the different scenarios. Work in progress.
